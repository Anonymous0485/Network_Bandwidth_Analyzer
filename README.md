**Network Bandwidth Analyzer in Python**

**Overview:**
The Network Bandwidth Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to monitor and analyze network bandwidth usage in real-time. It provides insights into network traffic patterns, helps identify bandwidth bottlenecks, and allows for proactive management of network resources.

**Key Features:**
1. **Real-time Monitoring:** The analyzer continuously monitors network traffic in real-time, providing instant visibility into bandwidth usage.
2. **Bandwidth Usage Visualization:** Utilizing graphical representations such as charts and graphs, the analyzer visualizes network bandwidth usage patterns over time.
3. **Traffic Analysis:** Detailed analysis of network traffic, including top talkers, protocols, and endpoints, helps identify potential issues and optimize network performance.
4. **Customizable Alerts:** Set custom alerts for specific bandwidth thresholds or anomalies to receive notifications when unusual activity is detected.
5. **Historical Data Analysis:** Access historical data to track network usage trends and identify long-term patterns or changes.
6. **User-Friendly Interface:** A user-friendly interface makes it easy to navigate and interpret network bandwidth data, suitable for both technical and non-technical users.
7. **Open Source:** The analyzer is open-source, allowing for customization and integration with existing network monitoring systems.

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip or your preferred package manager.
3. Run the Python script to start the network bandwidth analyzer.
4. Access the web-based interface to view real-time bandwidth statistics and analysis.
